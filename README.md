# UE4-Game
A working module of 3d game by unreal engine
Core Idea:
This game is divided into four regimes, each separated by a kind of art that makes them 
different from others. One person that belongs from none of them is fighting to get those seven rings, 
which those regimes looted from his ancestors. Those seven rings posses some heavy power that can randomize your emotions.
This game deals with several other side line things that can heavily impact your game timeline.
